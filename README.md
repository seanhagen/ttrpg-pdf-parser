# TTRPG PDF Parser

I wanted a tool for pulling cyphers & artifacts out of the Numenera books, so I
built this. My goal is to make it configurable enough that you can pull stuff
out of any TTRPG pdf into a custom format.

# Longer Background 

I run games of Numenera with just Emacs on my laptop. I've got all the PDFs for
Numenera, but it would be nice if I could pull all the items out of some of the
books to put into a database or something I can use to build tools to use while
running a game. 

My end-goal is a tool that I can specify how many cyphers, with an option min
and/or max level, and I'd have something that'd pull that many random cyphers
out of the database. The cypher cards are great, but I'm trying to move to a
laptop-only setup.
